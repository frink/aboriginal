ARM v6, little endian, EABI with vector floating point (vfp).

This is a fairly recent ARM architecture (introduced 2001, actually shipped
silicon around 2003).  This hardware can still run v4 and v5 instruction sets,
but v6 is targeted to the newer stuff and should run more efficiently (faster
prformance/better battery life).
