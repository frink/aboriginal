DESCRIPTION="
Linksys WRT610n.

A small blue mips-based router.

This doesn't actually work yet, because the kernel doesn't fully support this
hardware without more patches, and trx image packaging needs an additional
32 byte header before the router's installer and bootloader will accept it.

TODO
