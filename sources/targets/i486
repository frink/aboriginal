DESCRIPTION="
An i486 based computer.

Yes it's obsolete, but there are embedded processors that use it.  The
existance of an FPU is assumed, even though some i486s don't have one. 
This is simply coz i486s with no FPU are not of interest to me.  Someone
else can fix that if they care.

Produced and tested by David Seikel.
