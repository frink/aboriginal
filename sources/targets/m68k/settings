DESCRIPTION="
Motorola 68000.

This builds, but qemu can't run it yet.  (The qemu m68k support is actually
only coldfire, an mmu-less subset of the m68k instruction set.)

The aranym emulator might be able to run this (with a different kernel
configuration) but that emulator doesn't support serial consoles.
